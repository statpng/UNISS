Description: New statistical selection method for pleiotropic variants associated with both quantitative and qualitative traits, based on a penalized regression and resampling approach. The proposed method first computes the unified selection score of individual variants and then ranked them from largest to smallest. With the cut-off value of the unified selection score, we can select a certain number of variants, controlling the number of false discoveries. Methods used in the package refer to Kim, K., Jun, T., Wang, S., & Sun, H. (2022). New statistical selection method for pleiotropic variants associated with both quantitative and qualitative traits.
